#Odoodle

	JavaScript
	HTML5 Canvas

Odoodle is the result of a nine hour hackathon. It aims to be digital Pictionary. We were hoping to build a small app that would provide some fun with our colleagues. We used JavaScript and HTML5â€™s Canvas feature to build a drawpad, and added some basic logic to make it a two player game. Although we would have loved to improve the final styling, we were happy to learn a bit more about using canvas and the interactive capabilites that come with it.
